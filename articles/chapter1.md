# HTML

This is the skeleton of any web app. HTML builds the DOM (Document Object Model) that browsers use to show you the content and all the interaction. There are many ways to build, manipulate or abstract HTML but in the end, every webdev should have mastery of HTML or at least know all the basic building blocks. And the most important HTML is simple!
