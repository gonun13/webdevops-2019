# Javascript

Continuing our body analogy, after the skeleton and the skin, we now need our muscles to do anything more meaningful than just displaying content. Javascript fills that role in web development. Although it shares the name with Java, in design, has very little in common. And it's current iteration, ES6, it's extremely powerful.

# Why use?

It's the last of the core pillars of the web. It provides the means to create interactive web pages and other complex web apps. Although in the old days of the web was a bit of a pariah, mostly because lack of proper support in web browsers, which in turn lead to server side languages gaining a distinct upper hand in building dynamic websites, nowadays it's a must use for frontend development and even managed to gain a bit of foothold in the backend thanks to Node.js.

# Our project

Now, Javascript is not the easiest languages to get into. Its particular way of doing things can be a little confusing and without proper organization can be very painfull to debug.
