# CSS Frameworks

The way to solve the consistency issue regarding your web app look & feel is to use a CSS Framework. They couple into your project by defining some standard CSS classes and normalizing all HTML elements. Then you can add your own CSS after it to customize your app.

## Why use?

This will guaranteee you project will look the same in all devices and provide a better user experience across resolutions. It's also a great way to speed up development by proving tools to create layouts and apply themes. Finally and also very important, it will allow other designers and frontend developers to have a set of rules to adhere when it's time to expand. 

## The project

What to use then? Well, you can design your own CSS framework from scratch. Sometimes a project might be big enough to justify it. But with the volume of different offerings you can find nowadays I would strongly advise against it. As an architect, you should study the market and find one that suits your needs.

Looking at a list of the most popular frameworks at the moment: 
Bootstrap, Semantic,	Materialize, Bulma, Foundation Zurb,	Pure CSS, Skeleton, Uikit, Spectre, Tachyons.

We will sort through them according to some requisites:
- Consistency: looks the same in all devices and resolutions.
- No javascript: we don't want to cause any interference down the stack.
- Semantic: it's important for humans to understand what they're doing.
- Lightweight: reduced bloat and less interference with your own styles.
- Easy to learn: the closer to regular HTML and CSS the better.
- Quickstart: has samples for some layouts and themes.

After a close race between Bulma and Pure CSS, the decision for this case will be Bulma. It's not as lightweight as Pure CSS but the semantic approach won me over. Remember, there is no right or best choice in this case but only the right and best choice for you. Define your values and then choose one.
